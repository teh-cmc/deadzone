profilHub is a hub of debugging and profiling tools for Linux.

It aims to gather useful existing profilers and analyzing tools into one beautiful place, in order to help C and C++ developers to check the stability and to enhance the performances of their code in fast, intuitive and interactive ways.

profilHub comes in different flavors:

* A graphical interface powered by [Qt](http://qt-project.org/)
* A terminal interface powered by [ncurses](http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/)
* A [vim](http://www.vim.org/) plugin

*profilHub is not an IDE, and does not wish to become one. At all.*
