## Code

### Coding style

Please refer to existing code and try to keep the same coding style as the one currently used.

If you have any doubt, feel free to ask any question in the [issues tracker](issues)

Also, keep in mind: **a function should do one thing, and it should do it well**.

## Commits

### What should I know?

A few things:

* If you're planning to implement a new feature, it is probably a good idea to talk about it on the [tracker](issues) before you start coding
* In general, if you're not 100% sure that what you're doing should be in the project, [talk about it](issues)!
* Please never commit code that cannot compile, even if this commit is in the middle of your branch and noone will ever notice it. Please.
* **A commit should do one thing, and it should do it well**
* **A branch name should state clearly what that branch does**

### How do I commit?

By following these simple steps:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/reyclement/profilHub/fork) profilHub's repository
2. Create your branch (`git checkout -b my-branch-where-I-did-smth`)
3. If you wish, add yourself to the contributors in [README.md](https://github.com/reyclement/profilHub#contributors) (`* [firstname lastname](https://github.com/yournick)`)
4. Code and commit your changes
5. Push to your branch (`git push origin my-branch-where-I-did-smth`)
6. Create your new Pull Request

And, voila! You've shared your work, thank you!
