Otogonf is a toolset allowing you to manage your configuration files locally as well as remotely.

It is composed of:

- Otolib (https://github.com/teh-cmc/otogonf/otolib): a Go library allowing you to load your config files and to automatically generate REST APIs to handle them remotely

- Otocli (https://github.com/teh-cmc/otogonf/otocli): a command-line client to use these APIs and a daemon to use otogonf in a language agnostic way
